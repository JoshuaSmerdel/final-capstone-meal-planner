        MealMapÂ©, you can enter and save all your favorite <strong>
          <router-link v-bind:to="{ name: 'recipes' }">recipes</router-link>
        </strong>. You can <strong>
          <router-link v-bind:to="{ name: 'modify-recipe' }">modify</router-link>
        </strong> a recipe in your library too. You can also use MealMap to plan your weekly meals. Recipes can be added
        to specific meals on certain days. MealMap even reads your <strong>
          <router-link v-bind:to="{ name: 'meal-plan' }">meal plan</router-link>
        </strong> and populates a <strong>
          <router-link v-bind:to="{ name: 'grocery-list' }">grocery list</router-link>
        </strong> for you! You can also check what <strong>
          <router-link v-bind:to="{ name: 'ingredient-list'}">ingredients</router-link>
        </strong> you have already so that you're
        not buying unnecessary items.
