    (do we want each recipe to be a card or in a table format? would be kinda cool to show as a card like pinterest?)
    
    Add link to enter new recipe (component - addNewRecipe)
    Routes to RecipeDetail - then submit new recipe details (using RecipeService?) so that it's then added to recipe list -->
